# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis with MySQL

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **COVID-19 global datasets** using MySQL.  
The goal is to explore trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations while showcasing SQL-based data exploration and analysis skills.

---

## 📂 Dataset
The project uses **two CSV files**:

1. **`covid_deaths.csv`** – COVID-19 total cases, deaths, and population data by country and date.
2. **`covid_vaccinations.csv`** – COVID-19 vaccination progress per country and date.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **MySQL** – Database & SQL queries
- **MySQL Workbench Import Wizard** – For loading CSV files into tables
- **CSV Files** – Data format

---

## 📊 Analysis Plan
Queries (to be added soon) will include:
- Country-wise total COVID-19 cases and deaths
- Global death percentage
- Countries with the highest infection rates per population
- Continent-level case and death summaries
- Vaccination progress tracking
- Rolling vaccination counts

> **Note:** SQL files in this repository are currently **placeholders** and will be filled in future updates.

---

## 🧹 Data Preparation Plan
- Handle missing or `NULL` values
- Ensure consistent date formats
- Set proper numeric data types for calculations

---

## ▶️ How to Use
1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/covid-sql-project.git
    cd covid-sql-project
    ```

2. **Open MySQL Workbench**  
   - Create a new database (e.g., `covid_analysis`)
   - Use the **Table Data Import Wizard** to import both CSV files

3. **Run SQL Queries** (to be provided in upcoming updates)
